## What makes music sexy?

For this corpus I took two Spotify playlists that claim something about having sex to the music thatâ€™s on it. One is songs to have sex to and one are songs not to have sex to. I hope to find the musical features that make music more or less sexy than the other playlist by using the Spotify API. I hope to utilize these musical features to get a first insight in musical properties and link these to cognitive functions in either stimulation of the brain or even the parts that give us sexual arousal. However, I only expect to find a link between general positive stimulation of brain.

To achieve this I will first look for major differences in the musical features presented by Spotify to see if I can find differences.  When I have found differences I will compare these with a visual graph to make the data visual an readable. Some of the outliers I will first look for the features that make them stand out an if I can keep the songs.
